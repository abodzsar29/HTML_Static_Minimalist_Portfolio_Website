Minimalist Portfolio Website Project - NOTE: THE WEBSITE IS ONLY OPTIMISED FOR 1920 * 1080 RESOLUTION

This repository contains all of the source files which I utilised to make my second portfolio website showcasing my web development skills with another hands-on product.

Standard HTML5 was used without a framework to scructure the web page, and CSS3 was used to achieve the styling of the product. JavaScript, its library jQuery and CSS3 was implemented to make certain elements interactive or animated. I also imported the GreenSock Animation Platform to make objects fade, bounce or float.

The website was not utilised as my personal portfolio website due to compatibility issues with screens larger than 1920 * 1080 pixels. This is caused by the usage of the CSS grid layout mechanism as the base for the entire website.
